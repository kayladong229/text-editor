# text-editor
Completed homework for the Module 19 challenge. The purpose was to create a progressive web application (PWA for short) which was essentially a simple text editor that allowed data to be entered into numbered lines. Any data that was entered into the PWA could also be saved to the IndexedDB database so that it was retained upon refreshing the editor. Other features of this PWA include the ability to modify data even while offline as well as the ability to download the text editor as a standalone application to local devices.
